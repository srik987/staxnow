This repository is dedicated to the development of a completely fair poker simulator. It stores game data historically in case repetitive users want to have their lifetime scores counted and measured for them.

How does poker work?
1. Add users to a game
2. Game is initialized:
    Round # set to 0
    Player wins set to 0
    Deck is shuffled #a new deck needs to be initialized every round
    Deal each player their hands (2 cards)
